# NeuralNetworks-ETSEIB
This project consists in building a generalized back-propagation and feed forward neural network only using lists. The objective is to demostrate the understanding of the NN concept and prove that you can manage to reach a solution with the tools given. Using NumPy is not allowed.

The information used for NN understanding:
